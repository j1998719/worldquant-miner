   1. fscore_growth
      The purpose of this metric is to qualify the expected MT growth potential of the stock.

   2. fscore_momentum
      The purpose of this metric is to identify stocks which are currently undergoing either upward or downward analyst revisions.

   3. fscore_profitability
      The purpose of this metric is to rank stocks based on their ability to generate cash flows.

   4. fscore_quality
      The purpose of this metric is to measure both the sustainability and certainty of earnings.

   5. fscore_surface
      The static score. An index between 0 & 100 is applied for each stock and each composite factor. The first ranking is a pentagon surface-based score. The larger the surface, the higher the rank.

   6. fscore_surface_accel
      The derivative score. In a second step, we calculate the derivative of this score (i.e., is the surface of the pentagon increasing or decreasing from the previous month?)

   7. fscore_total
      The final score, M-Score, is a weighted average of both the Pentagon surface score and the Pentagon acceleration score.

   8. fscore_value
      The purpose of this metric is to see if the stock is under or overpriced given several well-known valuation standards.
