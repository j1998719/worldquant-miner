    "hypothesis": "Stocks experiencing a significant increase in insider buying activity alongside a decrease in short interest exhibit a higher probability of outperforming the market over the subsequent 3-month period.",
    "rationale": "Insider purchases signal management's conviction in the company’s future prospects, often reflecting private information not yet priced into the stock. Simultaneously, declining short interest indicates a reduction in bearish sentiment, suggesting a drying up of short-covering activity. This confluence of positive signals can represent a mispricing opportunity, particularly if the stock was previously facing headwinds. The 3-month timeframe allows for the market to fully absorb the positive information and for momentum to develop.",
