TASK
================================================================================

Extract 1-3 actionable alpha trading ideas from this paper that can be implemented using:
- Price and volume data (OHLCV, VWAP, turnover)
- Fundamental data (earnings, revenue, cash flow, balance sheet items)
- Market data (market cap, shares outstanding, volatility)

================================================================================
EXTRACTION GUIDELINES
================================================================================

1. **Focus on Implementability**
   - Only extract ideas that can be coded in WorldQuant Brain
   - Avoid strategies requiring proprietary data, real-time news, or alternative data
   - Prefer cross-sectional signals over absolute thresholds

2. **Identify the Core Signal**
   - What specific pattern or relationship does the paper identify?
   - How is this pattern measured quantitatively?
   - What is the theoretical or behavioral basis?

3. **Translate to Trading Logic**
   - Convert academic findings into ranking/scoring mechanisms
   - Think about how to express the idea using time-series and cross-sectional operators
   - Consider the appropriate time horizon (daily, weekly, monthly)

4. **Assess Feasibility**
   - Can this be tested with standard equity data?
   - Is there a clear prediction (long/short signal)?
   - Is the turnover likely to be reasonable (<200% monthly)?

5. **Avoid These Papers**
   - Purely theoretical models without empirical validation
   - Studies requiring high-frequency data
   - Papers about exotic derivatives or complex structures
   - Research dependent on private information or insider data

EXAMPLES OF GOOD EXTRACTIONS
================================================================================

**Example 1: From a momentum persistence paper**
{{
  "ideas": [
    {{
      "hypothesis": "Stocks with strong 12-month momentum that also show increasing institutional ownership exhibit persistent returns over the next 3 months",
      "rationale": "The combination of price momentum and institutional accumulation signals informed buying beyond pure trend-following. Institutional validation of momentum reduces reversal risk and extends the momentum lifecycle. This creates alpha from the interaction of two distinct information sources.",
      "datasets": ["pv1", "fundamental6"],
      "source_paper": "[Paper Title]",
      "implementation_notes": "Use rank(ts_sum(returns, 252)) for momentum, proxy institutional ownership with changes in shares outstanding or volume patterns. Consider market-cap weighting.",
      "expected_characteristics": "Sharpe 1.2-1.8, turnover 80-120%, works best in trending markets"
    }}
  ]
}}

**Example 2: From a value-quality paper**
{{
  "ideas": [
    {{
      "hypothesis": "Stocks with low price-to-book ratios AND high return-on-equity outperform simple value strategies by avoiding value traps",
      "rationale": "Traditional value investing suffers from selecting deteriorating businesses. Adding quality filters (ROE) ensures value stocks have sustainable competitive advantages. The combination exploits both misprice (value) and fundamental strength (quality).",
      "datasets": ["fundamental6", "pv1"],
      "source_paper": "[Paper Title]",
      "implementation_notes": "Use rank(book_value/market_cap) * rank(net_income/equity). May require winsorizing extreme values. Consider sector neutralization.",
      "expected_characteristics": "Sharpe 1.0-1.5, turnover 40-60%, defensive characteristics"
    }}
  ]
}}

**Example 3: From a microstructure paper**
{{
  "ideas": [
    {{
      "hypothesis": "Stocks experiencing abnormally low overnight volatility relative to intraday volatility may signal informed traders delaying trades, predicting positive returns",
      "rationale": "Informed traders strategically time their execution to minimize impact. Low overnight volatility during normal intraday activity suggests accumulation without aggressive buying. This order flow imbalance predicts future price appreciation.",
      "datasets": ["pv1", "pv13"],
      "source_paper": "[Paper Title]",
      "implementation_notes": "Calculate ratio of (open-close) volatility to (high-low) volatility over rolling windows. Use rank(intraday_vol / overnight_vol) where high values indicate unusual overnight quiet.",
      "expected_characteristics": "Sharpe 0.8-1.2, turnover 100-150%, may be capacity constrained"
